An integer N is given, representing the area of some rectangle.

The area of a rectangle whose sides are of length A and B is A * B, and the
perimeter is 2 * (A + B).

The goal is to find the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area equals
N. The sides of this rectangle should be only integers.

For example, given integer N = 30, rectangles of area 30 are:

(1, 30), with a perimeter of 62,
(2, 15), with a perimeter of 34,
(3, 10), with a perimeter of 26,
(5, 6), with a perimeter of 22.

Write a function:

int solution(int N);

that, given an integer N, returns the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose
 area is exactly equal to N.

For example, given an integer N = 30, the function should return 22, as
explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
