A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested if
any of the following conditions is true:

S is empty;
S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.

Write a function:

function solution(S);

that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly
nested and 0 otherwise.

For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given
S = "([)()]", the function should return 0, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
string S consists only of the following characters: "(", "{", "[", "]", "}"
and/or ")".
