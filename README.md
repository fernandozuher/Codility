# Codility

I have practiced my programming poliglotysm in [Codility for Programmers](https://app.codility.com/programmers) during my free time:

> Become a better programmer. Develop your coding skills with our programming lessons. Take part in our programming challenges.

... by solving programming problems in 5 languages: C, C++, Java, Python and JavaScript.

For me, writing code in several programming languages has been a way of relaxing. ðŸ˜Œ

All problems are solved in the 5 aforementioned languages.
I write code in a language by just following the way of thinking in the own language. I ***did not*** just translate the solution written in a language to another. For example, some particular ways of thinking in the languages:

What | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
initializer | `=` | `{}` list-initializer | `=` | `=` | `=` |
primitive types | primitive ... | `auto` (without `{}` list-initializer) | primitive ... | - | `let` |
*null* value | `NULL` | `nullptr` | `null` | `None` | `null` |
traditional array | [] | `std::vector` | [] | `list` | Array class |
Dynamic allocation | `malloc` | `new` | `new` | - | - |
for-loop | traditional `for ( ; ; )` | *range-based* `for (auto i : array)` | *range-based* `for (i : array)` | *range-based* `for i in array:` | *for...in* , *for...of*  `for (let i in array)` or `for (let i of array)` |
boolean values | `0` or `!= 0` | `false`, `true` | `false`, `true`  | `False`, `True` |  `false`, `true` |

*Although I could use a particular language-style in other languages, it is not good avoid the own particular language-facilities.*
