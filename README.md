# Codility

I have practiced my programming poliglotysm in [Codility for Programmers](https://app.codility.com/programmers) during my free time:

> Become a better programmer. Develop your coding skills with our programming lessons. Take part in our programming challenges.

... by solving programming problems in 5 languages: C, C++, Java, Python and JavaScript.

âš¡ For me, writing code in several programming languages has been a way of relaxing.

The folders in this repository are self-descriptive. All problems are solved in the 5 aforementioned languages. I write code in a language by just following the way of thinking the own language. I did not just translate the solution written in a language to another. Taking, for example, the C and C++ languages, ***I did not*** use C code in C++ one:
- ~~`=`~~ -> `{}` list-initializer
- ~~`primitive types`~~ -> `auto` (without {} list-initializer)
- ~~`NULL`~~ -> `nullptr`
- ~~`traditional array`~~ -> `std::vector`
- ~~`malloc`~~ -> `new`
- ~~`traditional for-loop`~~ -> range-based for-loop
- ~~`using namespace X`~~ -> `X::` (not C code, but better for non-small programs)

Feel free to look at my solutions for the programming problems. Make contact with fernando.zuher@gmail.com in case of any doubt. :-)
