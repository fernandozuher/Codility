# Codility

I have practiced my programming poliglotysm in [Codility for Programmers](https://app.codility.com/programmers) during my free time:

> Become a better programmer. Develop your coding skills with our programming lessons. Take part in our programming challenges.

... by solving programming problems in 5 languages: C, C++, Java, Python and JavaScript.

For me, writing code in several programming languages has been a way of relaxing. ðŸ˜Œ

All problems are solved in the 5 aforementioned languages.
I write code in a language by just following the way of thinking in the own language. I did not just translate the solution written in a language to another. For example: 

| C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
`=` | `{}` list-initializer | `=` | `=` | `=` |
primitive types | `auto` (without `{}` list-initializer) | primitive types | - | `let` |
`NULL` | `nullptr` | `null` | `None` | `null` |
traditional array | `std::vector` | traditional array | `list` | Array class |
`malloc` | `new` | `new` | - | - |
traditional for-loop | range-based for-loop | range-based ... | range-based ... | range-based ... |
boolean values `0` or `!= 0` | `false`, `true` | `false`, `true`  | `False`, `True` |  `false`, `true` |

The folders in this repository are self-descriptive.

Feel free to look at my solutions for the programming problems. Make contact with fernando.zuher@gmail.com in case of any doubt. :-)
